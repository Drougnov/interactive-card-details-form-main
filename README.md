## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this challange I learned:

- How to add multiple input with one label

- How to change textContent based on live input values

- How to validate text and numbers input field

- How to place a character(letter, numbers etc.) after nth characters of a string

- How to add a 0 before numbers below 10

### Continued development

I'm not satisfied with the form validation. Right now, the modal is getting showed just with cvc input. I need to learn how to do things only after all inputs in the form are valid.

### Useful resources

- StackOverflow: This dosen't need explanation ;)
